#### question 1.
1. The $(t, \log (y))$ scatterplot suggests a linear relationship.
2. The predictive equation is: 
$$Y=259.58-19.46t$$
#### question 2.
1. The $(x,y)$ scatterplot suggests a linear relationship.
2. The $(x, 1/y)$ scatterplot suggests the best linear relationship, since the $R^{2}$ value is the highest. The estimated regression line is;
$$
y=6.9650-0.8102(1/x)
$$
3. At a wind speed of 8 mph, the current output would be $6.863725$.
